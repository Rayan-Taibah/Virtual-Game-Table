# Virtual Game Table
A general-purpose, browser-based game table for you and your friends. The client software is currently compatible with Chrome, and the server (requires [https://nodejs.org/](Node.js)) has been tested on Linux and Windows. 

To start a server on Linux, open a terminal in one of the game directories, and run `./start-server-linux`. Then connect in one or more chrome windows to `localhost:37777` to see how it works. In principle the process is the same on Windows but you just double-click `start-server-windows.bat` (I haven't tested this in awhile, and I think this may require some additional library files on hand).

More documentation to come!
