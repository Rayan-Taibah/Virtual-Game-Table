SOME IDEAS

 - Implement multiple selected pieces (generalize to an array, loop for rotations)

 - implement cards

 - Create selection box.
 
 - tantrum should scale with board and piece size
 
 - Server: add "general commands" to 
   - server alone
   - server for distribution to a single client
   - server for distribution to everyone else
   - server for distribution to everyone.

 - Find a way to handle two people on the same team holding the same piece. If the server
   sends held pieces with each update I think this would slap down the confusion.

 - have full update include selected pieces.

 - save and load board
 
 - have server recognize private communications

CODE IMPROVEMENTS

 - overhaul server code to be organized more like the browser code

 - incorporate all the socket stuff into the board object

PIE IN THE SKY

 - make server support multiple games simutameously? login/logout?
